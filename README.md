# Privacy Guide

*Helping You To Help Yourself*

The Privacy Guide lists apps which guard your privacy. Their background is white if they are uninstalled and green if installed. A tap shows details, which for uninstalled apps includes ways to install them.

It makes sense to install the apps in the order they appear. It is also helpful to install them as early as possible, ideally before **any** other applications.

The only way to try out Privacy Guide is to build it on your machine and deploy it to your phone. Required version is *Android 4.2 Moar jelly beans!*, i.e. API level 17.

## Disclaimer

This is my first app and I mainly created it to serve as a training ground. It is still in alpha and has [many limitations](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/privacy-guide/issues); it is not guaranteed that this will change in the future as I might not continue improving it. But it works in a minimal way and does what is described above.
