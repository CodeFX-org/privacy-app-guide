# Privacy Guide

*Helping You To Help Yourself*

The Privacy Guide lists apps which guard your privacy. Their background is white if they are uninstalled and green if installed. A tap shows details, which for uninstalled apps includes ways to install them.

The only way to try out Privacy Guide is to build and deploy it on your machine.

## Disclaimer

This is my first app and I mainly created it to serve as a training ground. It is still in alpha and has [many limitations](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/privacy-guide/issues); it is not guaranteed that this will change in the future as I might not continue improving it. But it works in a minimal way and does what is described above.
